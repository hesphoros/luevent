/*
  A "changelist" is a list of all the fd status changes that should be made
  between calls to the backend's dispatch function.  There are a few reasons
  that a backend would want to queue changes like this rather than processing
  them immediately.

    1) Sometimes applications will add and delete the same event more than
       once between calls to dispatch.  Processing these changes immediately
       is needless, and potentially expensive (especially if we're on a system
       that makes one syscall per changed event).

    2) Sometimes we can coalesce multiple changes on the same fd into a single
       syscall if we know about them in advance.  For example, epoll can do an
       add and a delete at the same time, but only if we have found out about
       both of them before we tell epoll.

    3) Sometimes adding an event that we immediately delete can cause
       unintended consequences: in kqueue, this makes pending events get
       reported spuriously.
